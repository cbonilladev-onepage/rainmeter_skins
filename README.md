# How To Use

<ul>
	<li><strong>Youtube Player</strong>:  
		<ol>
			<li>Download <a href="https://www.rainmeter.net/">Rainmeter</a></li>
			<li>Download the <a href="https://www.rainmeter.net/https://github.com/tjhrulz/WebNowPlaying">Web Now Playing</a> browser tool to read your browser's current video or song.</li>
			<li>Install and load your <i>youtube_player.rmskin</i>, which should load the application immediately. </li>
			<li>Enjoy. Youtube should display the video title and channel name, while Soundcloud should display your track song and artist. I haven't tested browser Spotify functionality, but it should work the same.</li>
