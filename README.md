### Here you go.

A small repo of some of my favorite Rainmeter skins, created by me. 

## Skin List

- ***Youtube Player*** - Original music player and album cover visualizer. Supports most online music players including Youtube, Soundcloud, and more. 
- ***Youtube Player [Updated]*** - Modern Youtube player with larger font size and Spotify (both desktop and online versions) support.
- ***Marquee Player*** - Same as the Updated Youtube, but with additional marquee support to fully display longer song and artist titles. 
## Installation Steps

1. Download or clone this repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cbonilladev-onepage/rainmeter_skins

2. Place the skin folder in your main Rainmeter repository.
