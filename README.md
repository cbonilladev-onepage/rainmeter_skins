### Here you go.

A small repo of some of my favorite Rainmeter skins, created by me. 

## Skin List

- ***Youtube Player [Updated]*** - Modern Youtube player with larger font size and Spotify (both desktop and online versions) support.

- ***Marquee Player*** - Same as the Updated Youtube, but with additional marquee support to fully display longer song and artist titles.
